# ROSA with Velero and Restic

This article describes how to integrate ROSA with Velero for backing up user-managed projects. This is separate from the Velero instance that is used by RedHat SRE for backing up managed components. This integration will leverage short-term credentials using IAM Roles for Service Accounts and the default OIDC provider. Doing so avoids needing to create a dedicated Velero user in IAM and storing long-term credentials in a Kubernetes secret.

Important disclaimer: due to a known limitation with Restic (https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/2958) it is currently not possible to restore dynamically created persistent volumes backed by EFS.

ROSA can be deployed as either a public or private cluster in STS mode as per these instructions:

https://mobb.ninja/docs/rosa/sts/

Do not install the Velero operator (OADP) from Operator Hub as the basic install method does not support STS operation. Instead we will use Helm to install Velero and Restic for backing up persistent volumes.

Create an S3 bucket in AWS that will be used as the target for all user-managed backups.

	aws s3api create-bucket --bucket velero-`uuid` --region ap-southeast-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=ap-southeast-1

Disable public access for this bucket from the AWS web console.

Create an IAM policy named velero-s3-policy with the following permissions. Substitute with the name of your S3 bucket accordingly.

	{
	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
	    "Statement": [
	       {
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Action": [
	                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
	                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
	                "ec2:CreateTags",
	                "ec2:CreateVolume",
	                "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
	                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
	            ],
	            "Resource": "*"
	        },			
	        {
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Action": [
	                "s3:GetObject",
	                "s3:DeleteObject",
	                "s3:PutObject",
	                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
	                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
	            ],
	            "Resource": [
	                "arn:aws:s3:::<your S3 bucket>/*"
	            ]
	        },
	        {
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Action": [
	                "s3:ListBucket"
	            ],
	            "Resource": [
	                "arn:aws:s3:::<your S3 bucket>"
	            ]
	        }
	    ]
	}

Create an IAM role named velero-s3-irsa with the permissions defined by velero-S3-policy along with the following trust relationship. Substitute with the name of your OIDC provider accordingly. Importantly use the name of a service account that is not already installed in the cluster.

	{
	  "Version": "2012-10-17",
	  "Statement": [
	    {
	      "Effect": "Allow",
	      "Principal": {
	        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<your AWS account>:oidc-provider/<your OIDC provider>"
	      },
	      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
	      "Condition": {
	        "StringEquals": {
	          "<your OIDC provider>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:velero:velero-server"
	        }
	      }
	    }
	  ]
	}

You can obtain the identity of your OIDC provider using the rosa describe cluster command.

Prepare a Helm values.yaml file with the following contents. Note that if you plan to use dynamically created persistent volumes backed by EFS you need to set the global setting of defaultVolumesToRestic to false. Subsequently you will need to enable restic on a per-backup basis.

	configuration:
	  provider: aws
	  backupStorageLocation:
	    bucket: <your S3 bucket>
	    config:
	      region: <your AWS region>
	  volumeSnapshotLocation:
	    config:
	      region: <your AWS region>
	  defaultVolumesToRestic: true
	#
	serviceAccount:
	  server:
	    create: true
	    name: velero-server
	    annotations:
	      eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::<your AWS account>:role/velero-s3-irsa"
	#
	initContainers:
	  - name: velero-plugin-for-aws
	    image: velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.3.0
	    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
	    volumeMounts:
	      - mountPath: /target
		name: plugins
	#
	credentials:
	  useSecret: false
	#
	deployRestic: true	
	#
	restic:
	  privileged: true

Use Helm to install the latest version of Velero.

	helm repo add vmware-tanzu https://vmware-tanzu.github.io/helm-charts
	helm repo update
	helm install velero vmware-tanzu/velero --namespace velero --create-namespace -f values.yaml

Run the following commands to verify the setup.

	oc adm policy who-can use scc privileged
	oc get pods -o wide -n velero
	oc logs <velero pod> | grep "Backup storage location valid, marking as available"

Test a backup and restore of a persistent volume (e.g., deploy a PostgreSQL databases backed by EBS volumes). Backup the namespace with the following YAML.

	apiVersion: velero.io/v1
	kind: Backup
	metadata:
	  name: postgresql-backup-1
	  namespace: velero
	spec:
	  includedNamespaces:
	  - my-postgresql

Check the status of the backup using the following command and confirm Restic was in fact used to backup any persistent volumes.

	oc describe backup postgresql-backup-1

Delete the namespace and resources therein and then restore everything via the following YAML.

	apiVersion: velero.io/v1
	kind: Restore
	metadata:
	  name: postgresql-restore-1
	  namespace: velero
	spec:
	  backupName: postgresql-backup-1
	  includedNamespaces:
	  - my-postgresql

Check the status of the restore using the following command to confirm all items were restored.

	oc describe restore postgresql-restore-1

Confirm the contents of the database were restored in the namespace specified.
